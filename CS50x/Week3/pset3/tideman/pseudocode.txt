1. Initialize variables:
  - candidates: an array of strings representing the names of the candidates
  - preferences: a 2D array of integers representing the number of voter who prefer

locked in to the graph
  - pairs: an array of structures representing the pairs of candidates and their
strength of victory
  - pair_count: an integer representing the number of pairs in the pairs array
  - candidate_count: an integer representing the nuumber the nuumber of candidates

2. Parse command line arguments and populate the candidates array

3. Initialize the preferences and locked arrays to zero

4. Prompt the user for the number of voters and store the value in a variable

5. For each voter:

  b. Call the vote function and pass it the ranks array as an argument
  c. Call the record_preferences function and pass it the ranks array as an argument

6. Call the add_pairs function
7. Call the sort_pairs function
8. Call the sort_pairs function
9. Call the sort_pairs function
