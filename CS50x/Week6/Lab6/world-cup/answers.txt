Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulation (10 and 100), Brazil is the winner,
while Belgium takes the first place from 1000 to 1000000 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems that the predictions stabilized after about 10000(ten thousand).
Nevertheless, if I had to pay a fee for each second of computation time,
I would stop the predictions after 100000 simulations because the execution time is always less than one second.
