This is a hash table implementation of a dictionary in the C programming language. The hash table consists of an array of pointers to linked lists of nodes, where each node contains a word in the dictionary.

The `check()` function takes a word as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it is in the dictionary or not.

The `hash()` function maps a word to an integer in the range [0, N) where N is the number of buckets in the hash table. The integer is used as an index into the array to determine which linked list the word should be placed in or searched in.

The `load()` function loads a dictionary of words from a file and stores them in the hash table.

The `size()` function returns the number of words in the dictionary if the dictionary has been successfully loaded, or 0 if it has not yet been loaded.

The `unload()` function frees the memory used by the hash table and the linked lists, unloading the dictionary from memory.
