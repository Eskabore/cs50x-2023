    To characterize the audio aura of the listener whose top 100 songs from 2018 are contained in the `songs.db` database,
we can calculate the average energy, valence and danceability of their top 100 songs
using the following query:

```
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs LIMIT 100;
```

The results are as follow:

 AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646

Based on the average energy, valence, and danceability values, it seems the the listener's audio aura is
fairly energetic, with a moderate level of positivity (as indicated by the valence value) and
a high level of danceability.
This suggests that the listener tends to prefer music that is energetic and upbeat, with a positive
and lively mood.

    However, this method of calculating the audio aura may not be very representative of the listener's actual
preferences and listening habits.
The reason is the audio aura we've been presented is based only on the top 100 song of the listener from
a single year, and does not take into account their overall listening history nor the full range of their
musical preferences.
    To get a more representative and accurate audio aura for the listener, it would be better to consider
a wide range of factors and to use a method that is based on a representative and comprehensive
analysis of the listener's listening habits and preferences.
